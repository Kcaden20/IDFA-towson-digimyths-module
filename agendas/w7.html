          <p>
            This week will be a introduction to our module. We'll get closer to our peers, you'll get to know more about your instructor. We'll start by talking about the computer. Before we can get into reintepreting culture <em>through</em> technology, we must first talk about the culture <em>of</em> technology.
          </p>
          <p>
            We'll be using this <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1GfNAxzXWTrr-fP6WrWLiGEZvrgxjTQxcDSqWYwTDhRA/edit?usp=sharing">Google Slides Document</a> for the interactive activities during this class.

                  <li>They should all not be a version of the same statement. (i.e All ten things are a variation of "We like (insert 10 different artist names here.)")</li>

                <li>
                  Afterward, you’ll find 5 things that your each of your stories have in common with one another.

                  As a warm up for this week's out-of-class activity, Students will be broken into groups and assigned one of the following community members:
                </li>
                <ul>
                  <li>Artists</li>
                  <li>Performers</li>
                  <li>Mothers</li>
                  <li>Children</li>
                  <li>Community Organizers</li>
                  <li>Activists</li>
                  <li>You and your group will be asked to think through what a computer would look
                  like if it was designed for collaboration with this community member. </li>
                </ul>
                <li>Design Requirements</li>
                <ul>
                  <li>Your design for a computer should think through the
                  following:</li>
                  <li>Think of the metaphors that govern our current computers <em>(Navigating like a businessman)</em></li>
                  <li>What would be the shape of this new computer? </li>
                  <li>How does one navigate information through it? </li>
                  <li>How does one communicate with others with this computer?</li>
                  <li>How does this computer morph to the culture of your community member?</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Sketch Phase (10 Minutes)
                </li>
                <p>
                  For the first 10 minutes, you'll only be asked to come up with different sketches and ideas in your group. 
                  You'll be handed sticky notes so that you can post things in your corner and space. 
                </p>
                <p>
                  We're in the ideation phase. You should be writing, sketching,etc. Do not feel bound by reality! If the computational technology could act and do anything, you should follow that!
                </p>
                <li>
                  Development Phase (30 minutes)
                </li>
                <ul>
                  <li>Create a finalized version of your chosen computer. </li>
                  <li>How you choose to present your computer is up to you</li>
                  <li>It can be a visual or formal output, it could be a performance of how the computer works. </li>
