          <p>
           Now having spoken about the computer itself, let's narrow the scope to the tools that exist inside shed—Computer Software. Instead of focusing on the decisions that lead software to look the way it does, we'll instead be looking at how software could've been different as well as how software and technology has intersected with heritage in different ways.

              <ol>
                <li>
                  Students will be split up into groups of two. 
                </li>
                <li>
                  You will speak to each other about your takes on a speculative computer with each partner having 5 minutes or so. Here are some points you can talk about: 
                </li>
                <ul>
                  <li>What would you like to add to it? </li>
                  <li>What doesn’t feel entirely done at the moment? </li>
                  <li> How did you incorporate the reading and video from last week?</li>
                  <li>If one of you did not read or watch it <em>ask your partner to summarize</em>, and collaborate on how the computer could be changed with the material in mind.</li>
                  <li>If both of you did not read or watch, please take the moment to read <a href="https://www.chris-granger.com/2015/01/26/coding-is-not-the-new-literacy/">Coding Is Not The new Literacy</a>, and talk through how each of your computers could change.</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Be sure to jot down whatever feedback is being given to each person's computers during the time alloted into this <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1IX3r10t0kLAOit_csoXyfcmxZ77WXJxNOMzzBpBpr2g/edit?usp=sharing">Google Slide</a>.</li>
                <li>After 10 minutes, the breakout rooms will be recreated and you'll be partnered with someone different to do the same thing.</li>
              </ol>
              <small>20 minutes</small>
              <h5>Class Discussion</h5>
              <ol>
                <li>We will reconvene into a larger group.</li>
                <ul>
                <li>Everyone will have 5 minutes to submit three points that came up during the feedback session via our Zoom Chat.</li>
                <li>It should be one idea per message! </li>
                </ul>

                <li>
                  We'll talk through some of the points in the chat as a class.

              </summary>
                <p>
                  All the examples show software being bent and changed towards the conceptual ideas that the artists and programmers want to take it. However, creativity exists everywhere 
                </p>
              <h5>Bending Software To You</h5>
                <ol>
                  <li>You will be assigned into groups and given one of the following office suite programs to use as an initial creative outlet: </li>
                  <ol>
                    <li>Google Docs</li>
                    <li>Google Slides</li>
                    <li>Google Sheets</li>
                    <li>Google Forms </li>
                  </ol>
<li>As a group, you'll take 5 minutes to survey the software you've been assigned and collaborate to try and figure out the extent of your program.</li>
<li>Here are some guiding questions to help you think through repurposing the software you've been given:</li>
                  <ul>
                    <li>What are the options of the software? What are you able to edit?</li>
            <li>Does it let you draw? Change colors? Change styling? </li>
                    <li>How can its options be used for artistic expression? Bend the Software to your interests! <em>(i.e turning a phone tree into a listen-and-dial horror game)</em></li>
                  </ul>
                </ol>
              <li> For the next 5 minutes, write down into this <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1IX3r10t0kLAOit_csoXyfcmxZ77WXJxNOMzzBpBpr2g/edit?usp=sharing">Googe Slide</a> all the tools you found out about the software and the ideas of what you can make with it.</li>
              <li>Now individually, you'll then have 15 minutes using the office software you've been given to create an artistic re-intepretation of your story. </li>
              <li><em>If you haven't written anything</em></li>
              <small>20 minutes total</small>
