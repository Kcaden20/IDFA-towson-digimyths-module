        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>
          Individuals who were raised in a culture other than that of their
          parents and family or their ethnic background, often have a deeply
          complex sense of who they are and where they belong; i.e. in a place
          that exists in concept only. Deepened by the impact of COVID-19, this
          place fades as connecting with family in-person and trips to visit
          their familial lands become sporadic or inaccessible, and holding on
          to one’s heritage becomes harder. </p>
       <p>In the second portion of IDFA 470,
          <em>The Media Module (DigiMyths)</em>, we will explore how writing and language
          tied to a space can expand and iterate beyond its textual beginnings
          into embodied, dynamic, computational forms that converse with
          geophysicality, place and heritage in different ways. By the end of
          this module, students’ initial stories will have grown into iterative
          multimedia experiences with the goal being to provide a new
          perspective, regardless of which way students choose to present their
          stories in the end.
        </p>
        <p>
          This course will be interested in addressing questions such as:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Who or what has informed our relationship to our ancestry and how can be channeled through digital means? 
          </li>
          <li>
            What do computer technologies and network culture offer as a medium for exploration of our own heritage?
          </li>
          <li>
How can we connect with our histories through mediums and spaces that matter to us?
          </li>
          <li>
           Why is so much of our understanding of our respective cultures tied to geo-physicality? 
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Over the course of the next four weeks, we will be iterating on your story to create new multimedia ways of experiencing the words.

          Outcomes
        </h3>
        <strong>With the modular and iterative nature of this module, there are a few goals that this module could provide students with.
        </strong>
        <ul>
          <li>
Students should have gotten the time and space to translate their short stories into new experiences
          </li>
          <li>
Time to speculate, research, decide and mockup concepts for potential work.
          </li>
          <li>
Been introduced to network culture and alternative relationships to technology that can be connected to their story and heritage. 
          </li>
          <li>

        <h4>Syllabus</h4>
        <p>
          The class objectives include an exploration of story through examining place in black history, culture and heritage.  The class will be interdisciplinary and begin with introductions by all instructors on September 30.  The class structure is in three parts and includes:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <strong><li>Storytelling and Creative Writing (September 13 - October 4, 2021)</li></strong>
          Arola by Zakes Mda for students to write a single-effect character-driven short story with flat and round characters that have adequate motivation and justification underlying their actions, and whose conflict develops in a narrative arc to its climax. This means that this class is not interested in pieces that are sustained only by voice or in open-structure stories. Our focus is on the traditional narrative structure.
          <strong><li>Network Cultures using Digimyths with Kevin Cadena (October 11- November 1, 2021)</li></strong>
          Dynamic, Interactive, Interconnectivity, archival sense of being seen digital tools that include.  This ongoing research class will culminate each year in multi-dimensional presentations.  
          <strong><li>Mapping and PPGIS with Charla Burnett  (November 8 - 29, 2021) </li></strong>
          Looking at ways that storytelling can exist in participatory mapping can be used to broaden access to spatial data and technology for socially and economically marginalized groups to facilitate decision-making.
        </ol>

        <h4>Concept Objectives and Timeline</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Explore our spatial understanding of African worlds through the arts, network cultures, and storytelling</li>
          <li>Encourage a curiosity and passion for research, writing and performance with a digital application component to discover new ways of looking at the world</li>
          <li>Enlighten the Towson community into appreciating black history and achievements in the family of humanity.</li>
        </ul>

          This course is a reinterpretation of <a href="http://digimyths.online"><em>DigiMtyhs</em></a>, an artist run project with origins as a alternative educational program exploring permutations of "Digital Folklore". The project seeks to give artists opportunities to explore their unique intersection of interactive media and cultural storytelling. Many thanks also go to Mukwae Wabei Siyolwe for coordinating this course and giving us the opportunity as well as Zakes Mda and Charla Burnett for being co-teachers.
